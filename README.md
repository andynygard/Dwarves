Dwarves
=======
Dwarf Fortress crosses Terraria.. likely to be released not long after HL3 and DNF2 are out! :P

Played around with:
 * Applying Perlin and Simplex noise to generate terrain
 * Generating 3D terrain mesh via marching cubes algorithm
 * Mutation of terrain mesh when digging, allowing lighting to adjust according to nearby sources
 * Triplanar texturing via surface shader, for some smooth blending between textures from floor to wall
 * Infinite world size, as terrain chunks are loaded and offloaded as the camera approaches
 * Unity3D and XNA platforms
